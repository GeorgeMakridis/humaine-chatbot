- **Self-audit** — if Cursor notices new recurring patterns (e.g., swapped reward weights, renamed endpoints), it must run `/Generate Cursor Rules` to patch or append rules.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Versioning** — place rule changes in their own PR labeled `type/rules`; reviewers can diff guidelines like normal code.  
- **Deprecation** — when a rule becomes obsolete, mark with `DEPRECATED:` header and schedule removal in the next minor version.
